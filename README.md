<h2> The Verdant Vision </h2>
<br>
<i>It's the AirBnB of community gardens</i>
<br>
<br>
    <p>Supermarkets, kitchens, grain mills, barns, what do all these places have in common?  We gather(ed) in them and we go to them to get the food.  Over time, these meeting places have been cut off or replaced by unsustainable food supply networks.  If you've felt like community gardens are too restrictive and Community Supported Agriculture doesn't allow for the involvment you'd like then you too believe there is a place for Ufarms, micro community gardens hosted on residential Ufreeholders and tended by renting Ufarmers.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Address Food Waste </h2>
<br>
<br>
    <p>
      While our current grocery supply chain is an impressive feat of modern logistics, it places avaibility above any other expense and wastes a large amount of the food we grow.

    In the process seem to have lost our ability to care for the land and eachother.  Ufarms is about seeing a world where everyone living in cities has access to grow their own food and connect with their neighbors again.

<h2> How it's Intended to Grow </h2>
<br>
<br>
    <body> At it's core, this project is meant to do two things. First organise a club of Ufolks, Ufarmers, and Ufreeholders.  Second, give them the means to connect and self organize.  <b>First a map, so we can find the way back.</b>
